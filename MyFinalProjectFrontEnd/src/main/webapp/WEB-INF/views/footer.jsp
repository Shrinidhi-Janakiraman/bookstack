<p>For bibliophiles, a book is their universe from where they withdraw inspiration, 
motivation, empathise or become one with the characters of the story and experience
the rare sort of an euphoria that even materialistic things cannot bring. 
Like good, old and loyal friends, books come to rescue each time you are 
put into trouble to offer the gems of wisdom locked in words. They are are also 
like time-machine that takes us to meet the legends of the past and their captivating 
history. Maybe that's why, there's no other better mentor than books; no bigger 
inspiration than books. Now, with online books store, buying books have become really 
easy with multitude of genres present at one place.
